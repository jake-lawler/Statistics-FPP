# The Average and the Standard Deviation {#average}

## Chapter Notes

Nice quote from Galton heads the chapter. I first read this quote in "The Empire of Chance", and there it seemed to be a pointed criticism of Adolphe Quetelet and his obsession with "l'homme moyen".

The chapter introduces the mean, the median, and the impact on these of long-right tailed distributions (like income).

The chapter then introduces the root mean square:

The R.M.S of a list of $n$ $x_i$'s is 

$$
\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i^2)}{n}}
$$

We then get the standard deviation, a measure of the size of deviations from the mean.

The (population) standard deviation is the root mean square of the deviations from the mean.

$$
s.d. = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n}}
$$

There is some mention of the sample standard deviation (where we use n-1 instead), denoted in the book as $SD^+$, with a promise to explain the difference in more in chapter 26.
