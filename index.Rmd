# Preface {-}

For now just making an attempt to get this up on GitHub Pages. There are some errors in formatting and I'll come back and fix those later and also provide more context for this document.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Create a live view of the book.

library(bookdown)
serve_book(dir = ".", output_dir = "_book", preview = TRUE, in_session = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
